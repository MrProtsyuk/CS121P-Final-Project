# THIS IS THE FINAL PROJECT FOR CS121P @ Masters University 
## (Made by yours truly, me ðŸ˜‰)

This project is a TEXT BASED RPG that can be played in your terminal!

I made the entire story in about 2 hours, and the coding took me a little over 12 hours combined.

I had a lot of fun making this game a tried to stick to the basics that were taught in this intro class,
thats why this is text based and not made with pygame or something like that.

To understand the story a little bit more, I definetly recommend reading the Game Design PDF
but if you want to dive in and play, be my guest!

Let me know what you think!
